We have a visual layering bug. When I resize the video, the Playlist appears "on top" of the video area (overlapping it), making it look like the video is translucent.

Please UPDATE the CSS in `src/publishing/template/index.html.j2` to strictly enforce the Z-Index stacking order.

**CSS Requirements (Replace/Update these rules in `<style>`):**

1. **Hierarchy Definition:**
   - `#player-panel` must be **Layer 20** (Top).
   - `#left-panel` must be **Layer 10** (Bottom).
   
2. **Opacity Enforcement:**
   - Both panels must have `position: relative` (required for z-index to work).
   - Both panels must have a **Solid Background** color (`#101922`) so nothing can bleed through.

**Copy this CSS block exactly:**

```css
/* --- LAYOUT LAYERING FIX --- */

#app-container {
    display: flex;
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
    background-color: #0d1218; /* Deepest background */
}

/* Playlist: Bottom Layer */
#left-panel {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 10; /* Lower than player */
    background-color: #101922 !important; /* Force solid */
    border-right: 1px solid #233648;
}

/* Player: Top Layer */
#player-panel {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 20; /* Higher than playlist */
    background-color: #101922 !important; /* Force solid */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-width: 0;
}

/* Ensure Video Stage is Solid */
#video-stage {
    background-color: #000000 !important; /* pure black for video backing */
    position: relative;
    z-index: 21; /* Highest local element */
}

/* Splitters: Must float above everything */
#splitter-vertical, #splitter-horizontal {
    z-index: 50; 
}

Please apply these CSS changes immediately to fix the overlap issue.
