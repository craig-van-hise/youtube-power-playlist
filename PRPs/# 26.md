# YouTube Power Playlist

We have more work to do:

## basic search function 
 - get search working again (it got disconnected)

## Columns 
### "Orig. Date": 
enable editing of the date (because the agent can be wrong)
### "Rating" needs 2 things
	- enable the star ratings (right now clicking on them does nothing)
	- enable sort 
### "Notes" 
	- should be connected to the notes in "Study Mode" (it should be the same data)
### "#"
	- should remain visible at all times (take out of the filter list)
	- should remain visible when scrolling horizontally (so cut it out and put it above the viewport zOrder so it doesn't scroll)
	- use a play triangle icon instead of bars
