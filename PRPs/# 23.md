### 🕵️ Step 1: Locate & Audit the "Lost" Agent



```markdown
We need to re-activate the "Agent Enrichment" logic that we built earlier but which has stopped working.

Please search the `src/` directory for any python scripts related to "enrichment", "metadata", or "LLM" processing (e.g., `enrich_data.py` or similar).

**Once found, please read the file and tell me:**
1. Does it still have the logic to extract "Original Date"?
2. Does it have logic for "TL;DR" and "Tags"?
3. **CRITICAL:** specific instructions on how to update this script to:
   - Iterate through videos in `data/playlist.json`.
   - Skip videos that already have this data.
   - Send the Description + Title to the LLM.
   - **Parse the LLM response** to extract:
     - `tldr`: A 15-word hook.
     - `original_date`: YYYY-MM-DD (inferred).
     - `tags`: A list of 3-5 strings.
   - **Save** these new fields back to `data/playlist.json`.

If the file is missing or incomplete, please write a new `src/processing/enrich_library.py` script that accomplishes this.

```

### 🧠 Step 2: The "Enrichment" System Prompt (The Brains)


```text
Here is the System Prompt for the Enrichment Agent:

"You are a Metadata Librarian for a video archive.
I will give you a Video Title and Description.
Your goal is to extract structured metadata.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  "tldr": "A 15-word max engaging summary of what this video is actually about.",
  "original_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" (or null if you cannot infer a specific recording/broadcast date from context. If year only, use YYYY-01-01),
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4"] (Max 5 tags, lowercase, relevant topics)
}"

```

### 🚀 Step 3: Running it


`python -m src.processing.enrich_library`

**Let's start with Step 1 (Locate & Audit) above.** Paste that into Antigravity and let me know if it finds the old file!
